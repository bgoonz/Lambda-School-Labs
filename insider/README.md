## Welcome to Ghost Texts!

Ghost texts allows you to send a text message for $1.

That's it! Simple right?

### Built with ❤️

This code was written by four [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) students.

The frontend was built using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

The text messages are sent via the [Twilio API](https://www.twilio.com/).

Payments are processed using the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/).
