<APPLICATION> is here to help you, help your students.  Once they've learned from the master, it is time for them to head out into the real world.  To truly succeed, they'll need a little help.  This is what career services are for!  Now it's YOUR turn!  To help you in your endeavors, we've created <APPLICATION> to help you track your students' career search.  Who are they looking at?  How many applications have they put out?  Who has their resume?  Have they followed up?  Huntr.io is a great place to start.  Have your students sign up there with your company's link, and get a quick snapshot of their work here on <APPLICATION>.  We also support github!  Make sure your students stay active in their development, by continuing to use github.  Make sure they're creating, commiting, and pushing, by just glancing at a page.  You're doing your part.  This is a tool to make sure they're doing their's.
