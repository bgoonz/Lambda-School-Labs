# Quick Start

1. Put your environment variables at `/front-end/.env` and `/back-end/.env`
2. Inside `/front-end` install all dependencies and spin up the server:
   ```
   npm install && npm start
   ```
3. Inside `/back-end` install all dependencies and start the front-end:
   ```
   npm install && npm start
   ```

Now just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to visit the frontend, or query the server endpoints directly at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000).
