The goals for the data science team is as follows:
1. Locate, scrape, and clean data that is relevant to creating a customized route based on a user's vehicle specifications.
2. Locate, scrape, and clean data that our target audience would find useful during the course of a trip.
3. Incorporate data into an api for integration into our web and iOS product.
4. Perform value-added analytics on user data to increase customer interaction and overall satisfaction.
