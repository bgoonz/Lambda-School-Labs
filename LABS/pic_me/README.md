## Upload

* upload pictures and **tag** friends
* these **tags** are the **nicknames** of users

  ![upload-stage-1](/readme/upload-stage-1.png 'upload stage 1')

#### Note

* [**FUTURE**]: in the future, users may be able to upload more than one photo at a time
* there must be at least one tag present before uploading
* users can also edit tags of their uploaded photos on the my uploads tab
* deleting an uploaded picture does **NOT** delete the photo. It only deletes a reference to the photo
* [**FUTURE**]: add support for deleting uploads completely (for an amount of credits possibly) by also removing it from other user's collected photo

## Settings

* the Settings tab allows users to edit their:
  * first name
  * last name
  * nicknames
  * email
  * password
* users can also permanently and irreversibly delete their accounts
  * note: their uploaded photos, however (**at this time**), are **NOT** deleted
