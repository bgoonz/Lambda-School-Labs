## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

There should be an `app.json` file containing the following:

    `iOSKey` - this is your iOS Key for Segment (used for analytics with Mixpanel)
    `AndroidKey` - this is your android Key for Segment (used for analytics with Mixpanel)

## Testing

For testing, we used `Jest` and `react-native-testing-library`.

`Jest` was chosen for it's wide variety of testing tools and the fact that it came alog with Expo.

`react-native-testing-library` was chosen for its compatibility with React Native.

## Installation Instructions

#### Installation

**Step 1:** Clone Repo

**Step 2:** Install node modules

```
npm install
```

**Step 3:** If using Android

```
npm start
```

Then press `a` to run for android

_Before run android build, install and setup [Android Studio](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html)_

**Step 4:** If using iOS

```
npm start
```

Then press `i` to run for iOS

_Before running iOS build, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)_

**\*\*NOTE\*\*** - `npm start` is the same as running `expo start`

#### Other Scripts

    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
