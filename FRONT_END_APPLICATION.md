1.  I am interested in the Frontend End Role because I think it lies in the perfect middleground between creativity and technicality. 
2.  I have almost a year of front end experience that I think will be adequately demonstrated by the attached url.
3.  This role is my first choice I feel it most adequatly fits my strengths. Under solo conditions I usually stray tward new things but I think when working with a team that will inveratably depend on me, I would like to put myself in a position in which I know I can deliver.
