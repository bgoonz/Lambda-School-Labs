### Project Description

PriceMyAirbnb gives Airbnb hosts the knowledge necessary to make informed financial decisions when it comes to their Airbnb listings. 

PriceMyAirbnb is a software solution to the problem of properly pricing Airbnb listings. We use our comprehensive database of United-States AirBnb listings and cutting-edge data science calculations to lay out the financial landscape of user's locations. This allows them to see where they stand and make informed choices on their properties.

Registered users can search and save their listings via a valid AirBnb URL. Upon saving, users can maintain all their listings from a single dashboard. From there they can gain graphical insight into the pricing trends of their local area, and key comparisons between a user's listing and the most successful local listing of the same property-type.
