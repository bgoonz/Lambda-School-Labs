# League Management

League Management allows users to run all of their sports leagues from one hub minimizing the amount of time, energy, and resouces required. 

This repository contains the collective effort and capstone project of 6 students that will graduate from Lambda Schoolâ€™s Full Stack Web Development program in October 2019.

# Quick Start

1. Create your environment variables at `/backend`
   - Set up `.env` file in `/backend`
   - Inside the `.env` file `JWT_SECRET=SomeRandomString` editing the Secret with your random string 
> **Note:** The app will crash without these variables defined

2. Set up the database
   - `knex migrate:latest`
   - `knex seed:run` to populate the database with seed data

3. Inside `/backend` install all dependencies and spin up the server
   ```
   $ yarn && yarn server
   ```
   
4. Inside `/frontend` install all dependencies and kick off the Front End
   ```
   $ yarn && yarn start
   ```

Now just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to visit the Front End, or query the server endpoints directly at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

# Tech Stack

Our tech stack is React and Context API on the Front End and Node, Express, and PostgresQL on the Back End.  We chose our Front End because we wanted a fast rendering framework that when using Context API could hold state without prop-drilling and we had never used Context API before.  We chose our Back End because we wanted to keep the app unified using JavaScript throughout.  Node and express would allow us to do that easily and PostgresQL allowed us to have a relational database that could maintain better than some other options such as SQLit3.

<br />

# Scripts

## Running

From the root directory:

`cd frontend && yarn start` - Runs the Front end client

`cd backend && yarn server` - Runs the Back end server

## Back End Testing

We did a lot of manual testing to make sure everything works correctly.  Our main testing tools were Postman, terminal logging, and the Chrome DevTools.  Our Back End testing quick guide can be found [here](./Postman_Testing/QuickGuide.md).

# Environment Variables

These reside in the `/backend/.env` file, which is not in the github

| Variable         | Description                     |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `JWT_SECRET`     | `YourRandomString`              |

> **Note:** The app will crash without these variables defined

<br />


# Front End Information

Front end infomation can be found in the [Front End README](./frontend/README.md)

<br />

# Back End Information

Back End information can be found in the [Back End README](./backend/README.md)

<br />

# Security

Security is very important to us.  We will never store passwords in plain text.  Authentication is handled through the use of JSON Web tokens, and user passwords are salted and hashed for extra security.  Payment transcations are conducted using Stripe so that credit card information is never stored on our server.
