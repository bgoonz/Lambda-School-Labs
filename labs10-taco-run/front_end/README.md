# Labs10-Taco-Run

### Welcome to our Labs 10 project: Taco Run, an app made to eat tacos, and make friends along the way
---
## Why build an App Like this?
- Across the globe, there are millions of tacos eaten per year, but nowhere to keep track of where those yummy, scrumptious, mouth-watering tacos came from! 

  - Here at Taco Run we aim to make the taco-tracking process as simple as possible. Got a taco place you loved? Just add the name and location under your `favorites` tab!

- Taco eating is not an activity that is done alone either. 

  - Yup you guessed it, the Taco Run app handles that too! As a team, we noticed in the age of social media, that there seems to never be a time where we can get to meet new people and that is __no bueno__. 
  
  - We as a group wanted to create an app that fills the gap in interaction, allowing users to meet up over a shared interest of tacos!

### React

React is the current industry standard that offers a lot of out of the box benefits. It is fast, efficient, and scalable. Due to the large community, finding solutions to potential problems and reference material is much easier, even for a potential dev without a lot of experience who would like to contribute to Main Course. | [View Dependency](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Redux

A state management tool making it possible to store the entire state of the application in a single store. This means a unidirectional data flow, and as the application scales we have predictable state updates which subsequently make things easier to test and introduce new features. Redux also has solid documentation and an active community, meaning that as new devs become introduced to the project it's likely that any problems they face would have already been encountered by someone else, thus making solutions easy to find. | [View Dependency](https://redux.js.org/)


### Redux Thunk

A middleware that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. This functionality makes it easier to scale and implement features given diverse needs in a growing project. | [View Dependency](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

### Axios

A lightweight, promise-based HTTP client with an intuitive API that makes interfacing with a REST API simple. | [View Dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-axios)

### Stripe

A powerful, simple, and seamless payment commerce solution (Required by employer). | [View API](https://stripe.com/docs/)

#### React-Alert

| [View Dependency](https://github.com/schiehll/react-alert)[View Dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-alert)
